In the previous chapter we've seen how to create Data UIs for primitive data types.

Data UIs can also be created for Records. Let's assume we have defined the following Record type alias:
-}

type User =
  { name :: String
  , age :: Int
  , address :: String
  }

{-

## Without configuration
Now we can create a Data UI with the `record_` function like this:
-}

sampleRecord :: DataUI' _ _ User
sampleRecord =
  ID.record_
    { name: ID.string_
    , age: ID.int_
    , address: ID.string_
    }

{-

## With configuration
If the `_` is omitted configuration options can be provided for the record. This
works exactly like the configuration for the primitive types:

-}

sampleRecordOpts :: DataUI' _ _ User
sampleRecordOpts =
  ID.record
    { text: Just "A sample User"
    }
    { name: ID.string_
    , age: ID.int { text: Just "The age of the user", min: 0, max: 100 }
    , address: ID.string_
    }

{-

## Using the general `dataUi` function

If you just want to use the default options for each field, you can also use the
general `dataUi` function. The actual Data UI will be derived by the type.
This example is equivalent to the `sampleRecord` value above.
-}

sampleRecord' :: DataUI' _ _ User
sampleRecord' = ID.dataUi

{-

## Using the `recordPartial_` function

For now we have seen two ways to create Data UIs for Records.
The first one is to use the `record_` function.
It is the most flexible way to create a Data UI for a Record.
But it is also the most verbose one.
Then there is the `dataUi` function.
It is the most concise way to create a Data UI for a Record.
But also there is no way to configure the Data UI.

Can we get the best of both worlds?
-}

sampleRecord'' :: DataUI' _ _ User
sampleRecord'' =
  ID.recordPartial_
    { name: ID.string_
    , age: ID.int_
    }

{-
As you can see, we can make use of the `recordPartial_` function.
It is similar to the `record_` function, but it allows us to omit some fields.
Here we have omitted the `address` field.
The omitted fields will be derived by the defaults for the type.
