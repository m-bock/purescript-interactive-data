# Introduction

This manual is intended to be a comprehensive guide to the `interactive-data` library.

## What is `interactive-data`?

`interactive-data` is a library for creating type safe UIs for data editing.

## Code examples

At the top of each chapter you'll find all the imports needed to run the examples in that chapter.
Every example in this manual is __type checked__ and thus guaranteed to compile.
